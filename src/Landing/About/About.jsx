                            Heroes College was founded in April 2014 by Mr. and Mrs.
                            Tunde Bakare with a clear vision to cultivate God-fearing,
                            disciplined, and academically excellent leaders who will
                            serve God and humanity. The school was established to
                            nurture students into diligent, hardworking individuals
                            equipped with strong academic foundations and the values
                            needed to become solution providers in society.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The college officially commenced operations on October 15,
                            2014, beginning its journey at Heroes International
                            School, Gaa-Akanbi, Ilorin, with just thirteen students
                            and a committed team of four staff members under the
                            leadership of Principal Mr. Adekeye Temitope. By 2015,
                            the school had begun participating successfully in WAEC
                            and NECO examinations, marking a strong start in external
                            academic performance.

                            In September 2015, approval was granted by inspectors
                            from the Ministry of Education for the conduct of WASSCE
                            and NECO Senior Examinations, further strengthening the
                            institution's credibility. Since then, Heroes College
                            has consistently recorded excellent results in both
                            state and SSCE examinations, reflecting its commitment
                            to academic excellence and character development.
